\chapter{Multitask Learning using Semantic Relations}

\section{Introduction}
why multitasking? motivation and why we think it would work for our task.

\section{Datasets}
Tratz and Hovy dataset
\section{Methodology}
what are we trying to do? High-level
\section{Experiments}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gathering Data
    \item Preparing the Data -- \infersent embeddings, why \infersent?
    \item Choosing a Model -- keras framework, why keras? \\ Sequential model stacked layers, why sequential?
    \item Training -- 0.2 val split
    \item Evaluation -- 10-fold cross validation
    \item Hyperparameter Tuning -- dropout, nodes, number of hidden layers
    \item Prediction -- correlation scores for regression tasks, confusion matrix and accuracy for classification
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Single Task Learning}
\subsection{Multitask Learning}
multi-input multi-output model
